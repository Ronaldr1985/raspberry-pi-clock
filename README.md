# WaveShare 2.33" OLED Display

A small clock with IP address readout.

## Dependencies

The code requires the [BCM2835 library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/).

## Usage

As simple as downloading the source code and compiling it.

Just make sure when running the compiled binary you run it with `sudo` or as `root`.

## Disclaimer

I didn't write two of the files included in this repository, SSD1305.c and SSD1305.h, they were written by WaveShare.  I have included them here for your convenience.
