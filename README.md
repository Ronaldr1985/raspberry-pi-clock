# Raspberry Pi Clocks

Some Raspberry Pi Clocks.

## Supported Screens

Currently I've only written a simple clock for the [2.33" OLED display by WaveShare](https://thepihut.com/products/128x32-2-23inch-oled-display-hat-for-raspberry-pi).  However, I plan on adding support for more displays as time goes on.

## Usage

There is a branch for each screen, currently the only branch is WaveShare-233OLED.  There is a README in the branch for how to compile the program and how to run it.
